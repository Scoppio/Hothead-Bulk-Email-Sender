Hello {{name}} {{surname}},

This is a sample email created for HotHead Email Bundle Sender, created by Scoppio, a developer that was upset with the lack of free and open software for sending emails to hundreds (or even thousands) of people.

If you are using this code because others are too expensive, and you believe it is saving you money and is indeed saving you money, you could think of paying me a coffe at github.com/scoppio/hothead

Have a lovely day
